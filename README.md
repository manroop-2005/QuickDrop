# QuickDrop

Capture thoughts, drop files, save clipboard links, and check off today's tasks in a lightweight browser sidebar. **Zero tab-switching, zero clutter.**

QuickDrop is a premium, high-utility browser extension designed to sit quietly in your browser sidebar, ready whenever you need to store temporary text, scratch notes, code snippets, links, or files without interrupting your active workflow.
